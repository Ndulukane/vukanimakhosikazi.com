            <p> The Vukani Makhosikazi Community Project faces several challenges like: <br>
               Limited Resources: insufficient funding and limited resources may restrict the project's ability to provide comprehensive training programs and support services to a larger number of women in the community <br>
              It is very hard to reach their objectives and goals with the little to no funding that they have. One of the most devastating moments was not being able to chnage the situation when they would love to do so because of not having enough resources.<br>
